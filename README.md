Problem Type
This is a binary classification problem.

Target Variable
Yes, there is a target variable: diabetes
- Value 0 = Patient does not have diabetes
- Value 1 = Patient has diabetes

 What the Model Will Learn
The model is expected to learn the relationship between medical and demographic features (age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level) and predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on these features.

 Problem Description 
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can predict whether a patient is diabetic based on their medical history and health indicators. This can help healthcare professionals identify at-risk patients early and provide preventive care. The dataset contains 100,000 patient records with 9 features, where 8.5% of patients have diabetes.
